# Docker - Web UI

P2G provides a website user interface. Some key features include:

1. Configure your settings via a user interface
1. Trigger a sync from any browser (your computer, your phone, etc.)
1. Sync service can still run in the background, syncing periodically
1. OpenApi for custom scripts and workflows

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Install

*Pre-requisite:* You have either `docker-compose` or `Docker Desktop` installed

1. Create a folder named `p2g-webui`
    1. Inside this folder create [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/philosowaffle/peloton-to-garmin/blob/master/docker/webui/docker-compose-ui.yaml)
    1. Within this same directory, also create a folder called `config`
        1. Create two more folders within the `config` directory: `api` and `webui`
        1. Within the `api` folder, create [configuration.local.json](https://github.com/philosowaffle/peloton-to-garmin/blob/master/docker/webui/config/api/configuration.local.json)
        1. Within the `webui` folder, also create a [configuration.local.json](https://github.com/philosowaffle/peloton-to-garmin/blob/master/docker/webui/config/webui/configuration.local.json) with slightly different content
        1. Your final directory structure should look similar to [this](https://github.com/philosowaffle/peloton-to-garmin/blob/master/docker/webui).
1. Open a terminal in the `p2g-webui` folder
1. Run: `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`
    1. This will pull the containers and start them up running in the background
    1. You can close the terminal at this time
1. Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8002`

Any logs or generated files will be available in the `output` directory.  Additionally, you can learn more about customizing your configuration over in the [Configuration Section](../configuration/index.md)

### Configuration

You can learn more about customizing your configuration over in the [Configuration Section](../configuration/index.md).

If you are migrating to the Web UI for the first time you will need to reconfigure most of your settings using the user interface.  The only settings that are carried over and still configured via the configuration file are the ones related to `Observability`.

### To stop P2G

1. You can use Docker Desktop application to kill the containers
1. Or, you can open a terminal in the `p2g-webui` folder
    1. Run: `docker compose down`

### Open Api

To access the Open API spec  for P2G you will need to expose port `8080` on the Api docker container.  The open API spec will be available at `http://localhost:8001/swagger`.

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Updating

1. Open a terminal in the `p2g-webui` folder
    1. Run: `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`

## ‚ùå Uninstalling

1. You can use Docker Desktop application to kill the containers and delete the images
1. Or, you can open a terminal in the `p2g-webui` folder
    1. Run: `docker compose down && docker compose rm`
1. Finally, delete the `p2g-webui` folder

!!! warning
    This is non-recoverable.  Any and all customizations will be lost.  You can re-install P2G again by starting over.

## #Ô∏è‚É£ Changing Versions

1. Find the image tags you want from the [releases page](https://github.com/philosowaffle/peloton-to-garmin/releases)
1. Update the [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/philosowaffle/peloton-to-garmin/blob/master/docker/webui/docker-compose-ui.yaml) containers to reference those tags.
1. Restart the containers
    1. Run: `docker compose down && docker compose up -d`

!!! warning

    Attempting to use configuration or data from a later version of P2G with an older version is not guaranteed to work. You may need to reconfigure your instance.

## üë™ Multiple Users

To setup P2G for an additional user, simply download P2G run through the install process again in a new folder named `<PersonsName>-P2G`.  You will also need to update the `docker-compose.yaml` file to use unique names and ports for the containers.

For this setup, tt is recommended to place P2G behind a reverse-proxy with authentication.  However, that is outside the scope of this documentation.
