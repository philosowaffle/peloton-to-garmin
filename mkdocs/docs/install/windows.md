# Windows

P2G provides a Windows application available for download. When you download the application, everything P2G needs to run is self-contained in the folder you downloaded.  This includes all of your settings and other configuration files.  

For this reason,

1. You can always download and run a newer version of P2G without any risk of breaking your existing version.
1. P2G does not yet support multiple users, but you can have two instances of P2G on the same computer, each in a different folder, setup for a different user
1. To uninstall P2G simply delete its folder
1. You may wish to create a Desktop shortcut to the application for convenience

    On most systems this will move P2G to your Trash folder, which means you can restore it from there if needed.  However, once it is deleted from your Trash, it will no longer be recoverable.  This includes all of your configuration and settings.

    Attempting to use configuration or data from a later version of P2G with an older version is not guaranteed to work. You may need to reconfigure your instance.

### Available Versions

P2G provides two different versions of the executable you can choose between:

1. [The latest stable version](https://github.com/philosowaffle/peloton-to-garmin/releases)
1. [The latest dev version](https://github.com/philosowaffle/peloton-to-garmin/actions/workflows/publish-latest.yaml)

## üë™ Multiple Users

To setup P2G for an additional user, simply download P2G again into a new Folder named `<PersonsName>-P2G`.  When `PersonsName` would like to launch P2G, they should do so by clicking on the `ClientUI.exe` from this folder.  Addtionally, for convenience you can create a unique shortcut for `PersonsName` such as `PersonsName-P2G.exe`.

!!! tip Create a Shortcut
    Right click on the `ClientUI.exe` and choose `Create Shortcut`.  Place this created shortcut somewhere easy to find, such as on your Desktop.  If you have multiple people using P2G, consider renaming the shortcut to `<Your Name>-P2G`.

## üöß Limitations

Due to technical limitations, automatic/background syncing is not currently supported when using the Windows application.  Instead you must manually launch the application and select the workouts you would like to sync each time.
