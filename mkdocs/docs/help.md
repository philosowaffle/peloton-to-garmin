## Providing the right details

P2G can be run in a variety of different ways and its difficult for people to provide help if they have to guess about your particular setup.  When asking for help, or logging a bug, please be sure to include the below information at a minimum for the most effective help:

1. How are you running P2G? In other words, which [install mtehod](install/index.md) did you choose when you setup P2G?
1. What [version of P2G](#finding-version) are you running?
1. A copy of the log files that were generated, ideally the entire log file, not just the part where you see an error. See [Finding logs](#finding-logs).

## Finding logs

### Headless / Docker Headless

The log files will be written to `output/log<datetime>.txt`.

### Windows UI / Web UI

Naviate to the `About` page, then click the `Logs` tab.  Additionally, the log files will be written to `output/log<datetime>.txt`.

### GitHub Actions

If your forked repository is public, then you can simply provide a link to the repository and people can view the necessary logs from there.  If your repository is private then to find the logs for a given run:

1. Go to your copy of the repository
1. Select the `Actions` tab, along the top left of the view
1. Click the very first `Sync workflow`` item to open up that workflow
1. In the left hand menu, under Jobs click `sync`
1. Finally, expand the item that says `Run /app/PelotonToGarminConsole`
1. Share the logs from this view

## Finding version

Version information is always written as the first thing in the [log file](#finding-logs).  Additionally, on a UI version of P2G you can find the version information on the `About` page.
