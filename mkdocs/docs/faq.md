# F.A.Q.

Below are a list of commonly asked questions. For even more help head on over to the [discussion forum](https://github.com/philosowaffle/peloton-to-garmin/discussions).

## VO2 Max and TSS

Garmin _unlocks_ certain workout metrics and fields based on the Garmin device you personally own, one of those metrics is VO2 Max.  This means that if your personal device supports VO2 Max calucations, then your Peloton workouts will also generate VO2 Max when using the default P2G device settings.  If your personal device does not support VO2 Max calculations, then unfortunately your Peloton workouts will also not generate any VO2 Max data.

You can check the [Owners Manual](https://support.garmin.com/en-US/ql/?focus=manuals) for your personal device to see if it already supports the VO2 max field.

Garmin will only generate a VO2 max for your workouts if all of the following criteria are met:

1. Your personal Garmin device already supports VO2 Max Calculations
1. The workout is associated with an [allowed device](https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=lWqSVlq3w76z5WoihLy5f8)
1. You have met all of [Garmin's VO2 requirements](https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=lWqSVlq3w76z5WoihLy5f8) for your workout type

## Garmin Two Step Verification

Only some [install options have support](install/index.md) for Garmin Two Step Verification.  In all cases, automatic-syncing is never supported when your Garmin account is protected by two step verification.
