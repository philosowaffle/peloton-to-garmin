## Identifying content to add

Each Github Issue worked on should correspond to a bullet point in one section of the release notes.  Tasks performed that do not have a GitHub Issue associated with them should not be added to the release notes.  Sub tasks of a larger issue should also not be added to the release notes.

Say you are working on a new feature #413 and while working on this issue you did some refactors and updated documentation.
