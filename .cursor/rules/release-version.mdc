# Release Version

P2G follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Major Versions

Major versions are only incremented when a breaking or non-backwards compatible change is made to P2G.

## Minor Versions

Minor versions are incremented when new features or capabilities are added to P2G.

## Patch Versions

Patch versions are incremented when bug fixes are made in P2G.

## Release Candidates

Many changes may be made to P2G before a release is performed.  While pending release, the Version is considered a Release Candidate and the version number is post-fixed with `rc`.

### Choosing Release Candidate Version

If a release candidate has both a bug fix and a new feature, then the version should be a Minor Version increase.  In this way, the new version should always represent the highest order change that was made in the release candidate.

### Example

The previous released version was 5.0.0, and the current release candidate has a new Feature along with 2 Bug Fixes.

#### Correct

- 5.1.0-rc

### Wrong

- 5.1.2-rc
- 5.1.2
- 5.0.3-rc
- 5.1.1-rc
- 5.1.0
- 6.0.0-rc
