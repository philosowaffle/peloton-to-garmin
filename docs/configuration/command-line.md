# Command Line Configuration

All of the values defined in the [Json config file]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link configuration/json.md %}) can also be defined as command line arguments. This functionality is provided by the default dotnet [IConfiguration interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-5.0#command-line-1).
