# Migrating from older P2G Versions

P2G uses major release versions to designate when a breaking or non-backwards compatible change has been made. For this reason, when moving between major versions there may be some one time steps that need to be followed.

1. [Migrating from V1 to V2]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link migration/migrate-v1-v2.md %})
1. [Migrating from V2 to V3]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link migration/migrate-v2-v3.md %})
