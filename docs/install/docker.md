## Quick Start Guide

Docker provides an easy and consistent way to install, update, and uninstall applications across multiple Operating Systems.  Docker is extremely popular in the self-hosted community, a group interested in minimizing dependencies on Cloud providers in favor of attempting to keep their data local, private, and free.  You can learn more about the ever growing list of self-hosted applications on the [awesome-selfhosted list](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted).
